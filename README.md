## What's the TL;DR?

This is a visualization of evolutionary fitness landscapes. You can view them in 2D, 3D, and 4D (but you'll have to scroll through in 4D).The goal is for you to be able to understand and interpret 3D and 4D landscapes, which are difficult to show in flat images. I hope it helps!

## Where are these landscapes from? 

The <a href="https://www.epitropakis.co.uk/gecco2021/">2021 GECCO niching competition</a>, with modifications by me to integrate the C++ versions of the landscapes into our digital evolution software and extend the landscapes you see here into 4D.
